For feeditadvanced, the following parts from Ext JS are needed:

 * Ext Core
 * Ext.util.MixedCollection (included in the ext-foundation.js)
 * Ext.DD
 * Ext.DD depends on ext-foundation.js, Ext.Layer (which in turn depends on Ext.Shadow)


The Ext Core can be found in feeditadvanced/res/js/ext-base.js, the custom ext-dd.js file includes the following files from Ext JS 3.0 release:

 * pkgs/ext-core-debug.js
 * pkgs/ext-foundation-debug.js
 * src/widgets/Shadow.js
 * src/widgets/Layer.js
 * pkgs/ext-dd-debug.js

 * In the resulting file, Ext.dd.DragDropMgr.useCache is set to false by default to avoid positioning errors.

The files are concatenated in that order (manually for now) and then minified (through http://refresh-sf.com/yui/).
